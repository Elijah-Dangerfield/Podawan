        We follow the following format for our strings: nameSpace_usage_type

        nameSpace:
            Lowest common logical ancestor that owns this string.
            Frequently this will be the name of the feature module but could be a sub feature or
            a logical group in the app. Or for app wide strings it will be "app"

        usage:
            Where and or how the string will be used. This is very loosely defined. Ideally when reading
            it will give the reader information about which string this is specifically.

            examples: leaveDialog, userNameFieldError.. etc.

            Special Usages:
            bullets - refers to a text separated by new lines that will be rendered with a each section having a bullet point
            parts - refers to a text separated by new lines that will be rendered with each section being separated by some spacer

        type:
            What type of component uses this string. We have a running list of logical types below.
            New types can be added as needed.

            label
            text
            header
            body
            hint
            link
            action
            a11y

    -->

    <string name="appLanguageCode">en</string>
    <!--IMPORTANT: This must be at the top of each strings.xml file:
        When launching the app we compare the devices set language against the
        language being shown to the user in app (which is determined by the appLanguageCode above)
        If the device language is not supported we show a dialog explaining our support level

    Context on the game:
    podawan is a fun game to play with your friends.
    After choosing packs and starting a game everyone is assigned a role at a location except
    for the podawan who is kept in the dark. Everyone takes turns asking slightly revealing
    questions. The podawan's goal is to figure out the location. The other players have a
    goal of figuring out who the podawan is. When the time runs out, every player submits
    their guess. After the podawan reveals themself, they may guess the location.

    Users can play the game in two ways:
    1. Pass and Play: Game is played on one device passed around
    2. Room: Game is played with each player on their own device and they join a room with an access code

    App Wide String:
    String used throughout the app in multiple screens/contexts.
